      <description>We started this page during the Covid-19 Lockdown to connect people with businesses and services still operating in Brixton, and to help businesses move online quickly.
We thought if we could support local people and businesses in this small way, we might just come out of this stronger and more aware of what&amp;rsquo;s on offer in our amazing local area, and how they continued to serve us, even under the most difficult circumstances.</description>

      <description>This website was built (very quickly!) by Johanna with Hugo using an adapted Dream theme.
The code is publicly available at this Github repo and we accept pull requests, particularly on styling! Please check out our open issues.
Please get in touch if you would like advice on how to build something similar for your community.</description>
