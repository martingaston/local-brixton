      <description>These are odd times. Things are happening that are unprecedented. And that means we all need to respond differently. More importantly, we need to work #together.
We have come together to ensure that we keep services open and relevant to the challenges we all face.
So, we might not be doing what we usually do, but we&amp;rsquo;re still here, providing support to some of those most in need.
If you need help, then make sure you give us a call.</description>
