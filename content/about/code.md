This website was built (very quickly!) by [Johanna](https://twitter.com/visionsremain) with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using an adapted [Dream](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-dream/) theme.

The code is publicly available at this [Github repo](https://github.com/Johanna-hub/local-brixton) and we accept pull requests, particularly on styling!  Please check out our open issues.

Please get in touch if you would like advice on how to build something similar for your area.
