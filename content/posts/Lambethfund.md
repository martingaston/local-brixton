The world is experiencing an unprecedented challenge. It is important, in this moment, that we cooperate and do what we can to support one another. The Lambeth Food Bank Fund has launched to support our community and the organisations that can have the most impact on those that are most vulnerable.

The funds will go to the most vulnerable people during this crisis. They will be administered by Holy Trinity Clapham and delivered to food banks across the borough - including Brixton & Norwood, Clapham Park, Vauxhall, and Waterloo - that can help the most vulnerable.
