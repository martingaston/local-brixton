We are a Brixton based service for the homeless and people in need. However, we help people who are from London and surrounding areas. We rely on donations and volunteers to continue our work.

Brixton Soup Kitchen, founded in 2013 by Solomon Smith and Mahamed Hashi, has become a bastion of community support in the Brixton area, serving free meals twice a day as well as providing a clothing bank, a food bank, free to use computers with internet, and legal advice. The kitchen has become a safe refuge for those in need as well as a place for the community and friends to gather.
